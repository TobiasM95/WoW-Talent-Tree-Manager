You can __n__edit the loadout description there and create/import/export skillsets. Since skillsets are stored__n__inside the loadout which is part of the tree, you can save your skillsets by saving the tree__n__in the tree editor.__n____n__Lastly, select the "Talent Loadout Solver" to generate all possible combinations of talent__n__selections for all possible amounts of spendable talent points. Afterwards, you can filter__n__the results to include/exclude specific talents and load the results into your loadout.__n____n__Hint__cl__ This text can be edited!:Your loadout is a collection of different skillset that you can edit to suit various ingame __n__situations, e.g. a raid setup, an M+ setup or different PvP skillsets.__n__All skillsets are stored in the loadout which in turn is stored in the tree.
